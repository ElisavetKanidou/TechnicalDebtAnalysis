# TechnicalDebtAnalysis
Techniqal debt analysis project and improvement of software quality by reducing 


"GdxGame" is an RPG (Role Playing Game) game, in which the user is asked to protect the inhabitants
of a virtual village from various monstrous creatures, while at the same time he can complete a series
of side missions by talking to the aforementioned characters. More specifically, as can be seen from
the images below, the user initially selects the game settings, i.e. the keys he wishes to use and the
volume of the music. He then chooses between uploading an existing game and creating a new one
with the same name, as well as the hero he wants to play in the game. Then the map with all the
entities appears, in the form of two-dimensional graphics (2D Graphics) and the user starts browsing
the environment


To calculate the metrics and technical debt, the tool used is DesigniteJava, which is a software code
quality evaluation tool, specifically for Java code. With this program, the code is analyzed and smells
related to the architecture, design and implementation are detected. In addition, metrics are
calculated, with the result that this tool our team contributed to the reduction of technical debt, but also to the
improvement of software maintenance
